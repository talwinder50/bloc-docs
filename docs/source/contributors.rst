Contributions Welcome!
======================

**Contributions**

We will support the efforts within the Hyperledger and Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) communities to help create innovative distributed ledger technologies and digital identity networks. We believe that creating cross-project and cross-network standardization and interop along with common development frameworks represents the next step in transforming the digital identity space. In particular we support, and look forward to contributing to, the efforts of Hyperledger Fabric, Indy and the newly proposed Aries project along with DIF’s Identity Hub efforts.

Contributions will be directed towards the community projects above as well as open project extensions within the TrustBloc initiative.

In particular, we will contribute:

Hyperledger Fabric performance and customization improvements. We are excited to contribute improvements we learned while building and taking our network operational.
Enable DIDs to be managed and exposed from Fabric, and more generically enabling document provenance.
A model for digital identity exchange based on DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, and Hubs.
Efforts towards interoperability with the newly proposed Hyperledger Aries project, in order to use a Fabric-based ledger and our digital identity model. We think it’s critical to allow variation on top of a common base.
Tooling and demos to enhance developer experiences building digital identity networks.

**Securekey**
SecureKey builds identity networks like Verified.Me, the Canadian identity sharing Network supported by seven major banks, mobile operators, a major credit agency, and other providers in Canada. Verified.Me provides a user centric, privacy protecting identity platform for services that trust the individual’s identity established at their financial institution and other connected organizations. Users can link in account information across services for a convenient but highly reliable digital identity where information is delivered in real time.
